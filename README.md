# Reflex-Bin-CV
This project focuses on developing an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) capable of detecting, tracking, and physically "catching" trash thrown towards it in mid-air. Unlike traditional smart bins that simply open a lid, this system uses an upward-facing camera and Computer Vision (OpenCV) to predict the trajectory of falling objects.
